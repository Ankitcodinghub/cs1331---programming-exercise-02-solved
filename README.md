Problem Description

This assignment will test your basic knowledge of Type Conversion, Strings, and Command Line Input/Output. In this PE you will exercise ‚Ä¶You will be writing 2 programs for the following scenarios: building an elevator pitch and a basic four-function calculator.

Solution Description

Creating an Elevator Pitch

You and your friends are at the career fair and need help creating a simple elevator pitch. As the programmer of the group, your friend‚Äôs future job prospects lie in your hands. Are you up for the challenge?

1. Create a class called ElevatorPitch and create a main method inside it.

2. Inside the main method do the following:

‚Ä¢ Create a variable called myPitch that will save your completed elevator pitch as a String.

‚Ä¢ Create a variable called name that will save your full name as a String.

‚Ä¢ Create a variable called gpa that will save your GPA (floating point number).

‚Ä¢ Create a variable called graduationYear that will save your graduation year (integer).

‚Ä¢ Create a variable called hobby that will save your favorite hobby as a String.

‚Ä¢ Create a variable called major that will save your current major as a String.

3. Declare a Scanner variable called myScanner that will take in input from the user. Create a Scanner object and assign it to the myScanner variable. Use this Scanner object to read user input for the following steps. Do NOT instantiate multiple Scanners in ElevatorPitch.

4. Print to the console ‚ÄúEnter your full name: ‚Äù

5. Read the value inputted by the user and assign it to name. You should use nextLine() to do this.

6. Print to the console ‚ÄúEnter your gpa: ‚Äù

7. Read the value inputted by the user and assign it to gpa. You should use nextDouble() to do this. Note that nextDouble() leaves a newline character in your terminal (from when you pressed enter), which you will need to get rid of with an extra nextLine() call.

8. Print to the console ‚ÄúEnter the year you will graduate: ‚Äù

9. Read the value inputted by the user and assign it to graduationYear. You should use nextInt() to do this. Note that nextInt() leaves a newline character in your terminal (from when you pressed Enter), which you will need to get rid of with a call to nextLine().

10. Print to the console ‚ÄúEnter your favorite hobby: ‚Äù

11. Read the value inputted by the user and assign it to hobby. You should use nextLine() to do this.

12. Print to the console ‚ÄúEnter your major: ‚Äù

13. Read the value inputted by the user and assign it to major. You should use nextLine() to do this.

14. Assign the following String to myPitch:

‚ÄùHello, my name is {name}. I‚Äôm a {major} major with a gpa of {gpa} graduating in {graduationYear}. In my free time, I like {hobby}.‚Äù Where {name},{major},{gpa},{graduationYear}, and {hobby} are the values of the corresponding variables without curly braces.

15. Print myPitch to the console.

NOTE: Prompts, inputs, and output should each be printed on separate lines. You can assume only integers will be inputted for graduation year and only integers or floating point numbers will be inputted for GPA.

Enter your full name:

Dobby Bodd Enter your gpa:

-1.2

Enter the year you will graduate:

3005

Enter your favorite hobby:

getting tested Enter your major: computer science Hello, my name is Dobby Bodd. I‚Äôm a computer science major with a gpa of -1.2 graduating in 3005. In my free time, I like getting tested.

Creating a Four-Function Calculator

1. Create a class called Calculator and create a main method inside it.

2. Create a variable called firstNumber which will always be an integer.

3. Create a variable called secondNumber which will always be an integer.

4. Declare a Scanner called myScanner that will take in input from the user. Do NOT instantiate multiple Scanners in Calculator.

5. Print to the console ‚ÄúEnter your first number: ‚Äù

6. Read the value inputted by the user and assign it to firstNumber. You should use nextInt() to do this.

7. Print to the console ‚ÄúEnter your second number: ‚Äù

8. Read the value inputted by the user and assign it to secondNumber. You should use nextInt() to do this.

9. Print out ‚ÄúSum is ‚Äù followed by the sum of the two numbers

(firstNumber + secondNumber)

10. Print out ‚ÄúDifference is ‚Äù followed by the difference of the two numbers

(firstNumber ‚Äì secondNumber)

11. Print out ‚ÄúProduct is ‚Äù followed by the product of the two numbers

(firstNumber * secondNumber)

12. Print out ‚ÄúQuotient is ‚Äù followed by the quotient of the two numbers

(firstNumber / secondNumber).

The result should be displayed as a decimal regardless of whether the quotient is a real or number (e.g. print 2.5 for 5/2 and print 4.0 for 4/2). In order to do this, you will need to use casting to force floating point division.

NOTE: Prompts, inputs, and output should each be printed on separate lines. You can assume only integers will be inputted for the first and second number.

Enter your first number:

3

Enter your second number:

5

Sum is 8

Difference is -2

Product is 15

Quotient is 0.6

Submitting

To submit, upload the files listed below to the corresponding assignment on Gradescope:

‚Ä¢ ElevatorPitch.java

‚Ä¢ Calculator.java

Import Restrictions

Feature Restrictions

There are a few features and methods in Java that overly simplify the concepts we are trying to teach or break our autograder. For that reason, do not use any of the following in your final submission:

‚Ä¢ var (the reserved keyword)

‚Ä¢ System.exit

Collaboration

No collaboration is allowed on this assignment. See syllabus for more details.

Important Notes (Don‚Äôt Skip)

‚Ä¢ Non-compiling files will receive a 0 for all associated rubric items

‚Ä¢ Do not submit .class files

‚Ä¢ Test your code in addition to the basic checks on Gradescope

‚Ä¢ Submit every file each time you resubmit

‚Ä¢ Read the ‚ÄúAllowed Imports‚Äù and ‚ÄúRestricted Features‚Äù to avoid losing points

‚Ä¢ Check on Piazza for all official clarifications
